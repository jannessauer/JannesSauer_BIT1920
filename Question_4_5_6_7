Question 4

mysql> select gene_name,((seq_region_end - seq_region_start) + 1) as "Gene length" from gene order by ((seq_region_end - seq_region_start) + 1) desc limit 1 offset 2;
+-----------+-------------+
| gene_name | Gene length |
+-----------+-------------+
| PARP1     |     2493040 |
+-----------+-------------+
1 row in set (0,02 sec)

Question 5

mysql> select gene_name, count(exon_id) as "Exon count" from gene join transcript on gene.gene_id = transcript.gene_id join exon_transcript on transcript.transcript_id = exon_transcript.transcript_id group by gene_name  order by count(exon_id) desc limit 1;
+-----------+------------+
| gene_name | Exon count |
+-----------+------------+
| COL11A2   |       3598 |
+-----------+------------+
1 row in set (0,88 sec)

question 6

mysql> select chromosome, count(gene_name) from gene where description like "%cancer%" and description like "%breast%" group by chromosome order by count(gene_name) desc limit 1;
+------------+------------------+
| chromosome | count(gene_name) |
+------------+------------------+
| 16         |                2 |
+------------+------------------+
1 row in set (0,03 sec)

mysql> select chromosome, count(transcript_id) as "Transcript count" from gene join transcript on gene.gene_id = transcript.gene_id where chromosome = 12 group by chromosome;
+------------+------------------+
| chromosome | Transcript count |
+------------+------------------+
| 12         |            11610 |
+------------+------------------+
1 row in set, 5348 warnings (0,03 sec)

Question 7

mysql> select count(*) from exon;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|   642590 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0,03 sec)

mysql> select count(*) from exon_transcript;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|  1178393 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0,13 sec)

there are more rows in exon_transcript.
The way an inner join works is that it produces a full cross-product between the two tables. This cross-product contains a row for each pair of rows in the input tables. If there are multiple matching rows between the two tables, you'll get multiple rows in the result set.
